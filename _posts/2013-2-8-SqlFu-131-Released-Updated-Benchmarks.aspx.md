title: SqlFu 1.3.1 Released, Updated Benchmarks
category: SqlFu
---

Version 1.3.1 of SqlFu brings  helpers to make some tasks easier. For writing moderately complex queries I prefer Sql (I think it's easier than messing with Linq) but for very simple queries or commands I wanted to remain in C# land. Doing inserts or updates is boring with sql and while there was an Update method in SqlFu which easied the pain, it wasn't enough because it couldn't handle trivial things like:

  
```csharp
update Table set column=column+1
```
  So I've included a very easy to use Update Table fluent builder

  
```csharp
db.Update<Table>()
.Set(t=>t.Column, t=> t.Column+1)
.Set(t=>t.OtherColumn, value)
.Where(t=>t.Id==someid)
.Execute()
```
  Simple enough and it should handle 99% of usages of single table updating.

 Other helpers added

  
  * retrieve one row using strongly typed criteria  
      
```csharp
db.Get<Article>(a=>a.Id==12)
```
   
  * get column value  
      
```csharp
db.GetColumnValue<Article,string>(a=>a.Title,a.Id==12)
```
   
  * counting rows from table  
      
```csharp
db.Count<Article>(a=>a.PostedAt.Year==2013)
```
   
  * checking if a table has rows  
      
```csharp
db.HasAnyRows<Article>(a=>a.Id==entityId);
```
   
  * delete from table  
      
```csharp
db.DeleteFrom<Article>(a=>a.Id=entityId);
```
   
  * some table management utils  
      
```csharp
db.Drop<Article>();
if (!db.TableExists<Article>()) { //do create table }
```
    Nothing revolutionary but small things to increase productivity.

 
## Benchmarks

 I thought it is a good time to  update the old benchmarks (published in May 2012) comparing SqlFu to other micro Orms. I've dropped FluentData and revised the queries as things were not that equal (some dapper queries included an order by, Massive query wasn't iterated) and I've updated all the other micro orm to their latest nuget versions.

  It seems that performance is not that much of a concern when using a micro Orm. A few of miliseconds difference when dealing with 500 queries is negligible. Pretty much any micro Orm is fast these days so what will make you prefer one over the other is their feature set (did you know SqlFu has integrated support for [database migrations](https://github.com/sapiens/SqlFu/wiki) ?) and how comfortable you feel using them. And even if all seem to have similar core features, they do have different (not so obvious) strengths.
